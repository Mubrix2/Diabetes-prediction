# Diabetes-prediction
Using diabetes dataset from Kaggle, I built this Diabetes Prediction App using FastAPI for data validation and streamlit for the UI. 

Although, there's a biasness on the train dependent variable, the model's accuracy is not efficient enough, but I just used this project to solidify my FastAPI and the use of Pydantic model skills. I will work  on a more balanced dataset on Diabetes prediction and deploy it soon. Thanks
